![CheQQme Data Center](public/logos/logo-dark-vertical.png)

## Overview

**CheQQme Data Center** is an internal knowledge & operations hub built with Laravel + Filament, now featuring MCP server integration for AI/semantic search. It centralizes:

-   Important / frequently used URLs (SharePoint, tools, internal dashboards)
-   Client & project records
-   Internal documents & reference files
-   Action Tasks (Kanban style board)

It improves discoverability, reduces context switching, and lays groundwork for future AI-assisted search and MCP-powered automation.

## Core Objectives

-   Centralize scattered project & resource information
-   Provide fast navigation and lightweight task tracking (Action Board)
-   Serve as a structured dataset for upcoming AI / semantic search features
-   Personal fullâ€‘stack learning sandbox (Laravel, Filament, modern tooling)

## First-Time Setup: CheQQme Data Center

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url> cheqqme-data-center
    cd cheqqme-data-center
    ```
2. Install PHP and Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```
3. Create your environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    # Edit .env and fill in any required values (DB, mail, MCP details)
    ```
4. Prepare the database and storage:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed   # if seeders available
    php artisan storage:link
    # If using SQLite, ensure database/database.sqlite exists
    ```
5. (Optional) Set up mail service for local testing:
    - The default `.env` uses [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) for safe email testing.
    - Sign up at Mailtrap and copy your SMTP credentials.
    - Update these values in your `.env`:
        ```properties
        MAIL_MAILER=smtp
        MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
        MAIL_PORT=2525
        MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_username
        MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailtrap_password
        MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
        MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@cheqqme.local
        MAIL_FROM_NAME="CheQQme Data Center"
        ```
    - Emails sent by the app will appear in your Mailtrap inbox.
6. Access the app at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) (Filament admin panel at /admin).

## MCP Server: First-Time Setup

1. Navigate to the `mcp-server` folder:
    ```bash
    cd mcp-server
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Copy the environment template and set your API key:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env and fill MCP_API_KEY with your chosen key
    ```
4. Start the MCP server:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
5. The MCP API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api` by default.

Refer to the main `.env` for connecting Laravel to MCP (MCP_ENDPOINT, MCP_API_KEY).

## Action Board (Kanban)

Implemented via a custom Filament Page extending a Kanban board component. Columns reflect task lifecycle. Each card shows due date color indicators and assignment status. Future upgrades: inline comment thread, drag ordering persistence optimization, filters & swimlanes.

---

## Testing Strategy (Planned)

-   Feature tests: CRUD for Projects, Documents, Important URLs
-   Livewire component tests: Task comments & board interactions
-   Policy tests once authorization is introduced

Add seeds + factories to simplify realistic scenario coverage.

---

## Deployment (Basic Outline)

1. Provision server (Linux) with PHP 8.x + Nginx + database
2. Clone repo & run `composer install --no-dev`
3. Copy `.env.example` â†’ `.env`, configure production values
4. Run: `php artisan key:generate` (one time)
5. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate --force`
6. Build assets: `npm ci && npm run build`
7. Set correct permissions for `storage` & `bootstrap/cache`
8. Configure queue worker & scheduler (cron: `* * * * * php /path/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`)
9. Use a process manager (Supervisor) for `php artisan queue:work`

---

## Authentication & Security

-   Laravel auth scaffolding + Filament guard
-   MCP server password hashes compatible with Laravel (bcrypt $2b$ â†’ $2y$)
-   Sensitive files/folders (`.env`, `database/`, `storage/`, etc.) are ignored from git tracking
-   Next steps: add Policies (Project, Document, URL) & roles field on `users` table
-   Consider rate limiting if public endpoints added later
