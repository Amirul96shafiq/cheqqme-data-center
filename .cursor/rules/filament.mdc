description: Filament usage patterns and conventions for panels, resources, forms, tables, actions
---

# Filament Conventions

-   Use Filament Artisan generators for new components, pages, and resources; pass `--no-interaction`.
-   Follow SDUI patterns: configure Forms, Tables, Actions declaratively.
-   Prefer `relationship()` on form components when referencing related models.
-   Place resources in [app/Filament/Resources](mdc:app/Filament/Resources) and pages in [app/Filament/Pages](mdc:app/Filament/Pages).
-   Use notifications for user feedback within actions.

## Testing Filament

-   Authenticate and set the current panel when required.
-   Use Livewire testing APIs to interact with forms and actions.
