# Testing Guidelines

-   Prefer feature tests. Use factories and seeded data where helpful.
-   Authenticate as needed to access Filament panels.
-   Livewire: `Livewire::test()` helpers for actions, forms, and assertions.
-   Use `assertDatabaseHas`/`assertDatabaseMissing` for persistence checks.
-   When adding models, also add factories and consider seeders.
