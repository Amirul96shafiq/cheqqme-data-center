# Tailwind CSS v3

-   Use Tailwind utilities; follow existing class order and patterns.
-   Use `gap-*` for spacing in lists/grids, avoid arbitrary margins for spacing sibling items.
-   Support dark mode using `dark:` where the app already does.
-   Extract repeated patterns into components when duplication appears.
