# Migration Rules

-   When modifying columns, specify all previous attributes to avoid losing defaults, nullability, or indexes.
-   Prefer Eloquent relationships and cascading rules in migrations via foreign keys.
-   Use proper indexing for frequently queried columns.
-   Keep migrations idempotent and ordered; avoid editing committed migrationsâ€”create a new one to change schema.
