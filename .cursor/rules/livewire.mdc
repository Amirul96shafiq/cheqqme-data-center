# Livewire v3 Conventions

-   Namespace: `App\Livewire` and single-root Blade elements.
-   Use `wire:model.live` for real-time updates; `wire:model` is deferred.
-   Dispatch events with `$this->dispatch()`.
-   Lifecycle hooks: prefer `mount()` and `updatedFoo()` for state and effects.
-   Add `wire:key` for looped elements.

## Testing

-   Use `Livewire::test()` to interact with components.
-   Assert status, properties, and rendered output.
